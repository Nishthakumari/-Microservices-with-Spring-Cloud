In the previous steps, we set up the limits service.
In this step, we set up the Spring Cloud Config server and connect it to a Git repository.

Create  new spring project using spring-cloud-config-server

Dependency:
Dev tools
config server --> Central management for configuration via git.


spring-cloud-config-server/src/main/resources/application.properties.
here we're configuring server.port is equal to 8888, then only application will run.

We have just launched up Spring Cloud Config server.

There is one more annotation we need to add to it to make it a real config server.

Next step, create the GitHub repository, and integrate all these three together.
