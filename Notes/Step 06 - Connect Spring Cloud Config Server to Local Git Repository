Connect Spring Cloud config server to the git repository.

If you had any problems with getting this URL working, the first thing that you'd want to check
is to make sure that limit service, the name of this is matching the name of the file in here,
limits-service and make sure that this is default. And make sure that the port is 8888.
This is the same port that we are launching our Spring Cloud config server on.

So if you go to the application.properties of Spring Cloud config server, the port name is 8888.
