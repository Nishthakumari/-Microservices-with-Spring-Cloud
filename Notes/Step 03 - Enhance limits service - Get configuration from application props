 -> pick up the values from application dot properties and return them back in this specific controller.
 -> For this, we need to create a Configuration class, which matches structure in application.properties,
    Limit service is the name of the microservice and the minimum, maximum are the configuration values
    which we are storing in application.properties file.

 -> Add @ConfigurationProperties to map the value from application.properties file to Configuration Class.

 Thus we have enhanced our Limit service to get the properties from a property file. In the subsequent steps,
  we would want to connect our limit service to a centralized configuration server.
