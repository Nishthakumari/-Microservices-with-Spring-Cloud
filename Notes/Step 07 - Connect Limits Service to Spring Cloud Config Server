In the previous step, we connected our spring cloud conflict server to the gate repository.
And in this step let's connect our Limits Microservice to the Spring Cloud Config Server.
This would complete the entire chain.

We need to configure two important things in limit microservice

1. First thing we have already configured, adding config client in pom.xml , which says that it wants to talk to
configserver and url of configserver is defined in its application.properties.

2. what is the name of this application? What configuration in the Cloud Config Server
should this application make use of?
spring.application.name=limits-service, add this in application properties file of config server. This will
act as ID for talking to config server.


One thing we already saw is the values in the application.properties have less priority compared to
the values which are present in your gate repository.
